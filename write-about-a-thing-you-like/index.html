  <!-- [intro] -->
  <p class="intro">Well acquainted with the 'blank canvas', I understand the importance of limitations. When anything is possible, nothing gets made.</p>
  <p>Inspiration comes a little too easily. Creating anything worthwhile takes time and nothing half finished ever gets made so I try to cherry pick from ideas that would keep me motivated for the longest possible time.</p>
<p>Big fan of old 30's and 40's blues, Bowie from the 60's through to the early 80's, Nick Drake, Gary Numan, The Doors, Metallica, Mahalia jackson, Louis Prima, Pearl Jam, New order, Depeche Mode, kraftwerk, Erasure, Queen, The Smiths, The Decemberists, Spencer Krug, Alt-J, Orbital, Prodigy, LTJ Bukem, Hello Strange, Fingers in the noise. Inspiration from music isn't hard to come by.</p>
<p>Having a broad taste in music, thus browsing for old resonator guitar songs one lazy afternoon, I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGyLZV_nWE">cover of "phonebooth", by a busker who plays at Park Guell in Barcelona</a>. Two low quality videos, by passing tourists, where all I could find of his performance. Most of the youtube 'plays' on those videos are mine.</p>
<p>The chewn captures something pretty freaking amazing.</p>
<p>There's a sadness, a mourning, a passing, like the end of summer or the keening for a thing almost attained but never held. The sound of knowing enough about something to want it very badly. That wanting alone would never be enough to get it.</p>
<p>The frustration builds to a crescendo,  deflating to a sleepy sigh and a promise to try again next time. Never giving up.</p>
<p>Super keen to try and capture the essence into my own chewn. So that's my next big project. I'll document the track creation as a learning resource to look back on and tag the series "Park Guell", to help make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Probably make lots of mistakes; but "fail fast, fail often, fail forward" is how i roll.</p>
