  <h1>Making music</h1>

  <!-- [intro] -->
  <p class="intro">As someone well acquainted with the 'blank canvas', I understand the importance of limitations. When anything is possible, nothing gets made.</p>
  <p>I appreciate a wide range of musical styles and find inspiration a little too easily in things around me.<br />
Creating anything worthwhile takes time and nothing half finished ever gets made so I try to cherry pick from ideas that would keep me motivated for the longest possible time.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of old 30's and 40's blues. Bowie produced some amazing stuff from the 60's through to the early 80's. Nick Drake, Gary Numan, The Doors, Metallica, Gospel, Jazz, Pearl Jam, New order, depeche mode, kraftwerk, Erasure, Queen, The Smiths, The Decemberists, Spencer Krug, Alt-J, Orbital, Prodigy, LTJ Bukem, Hello Strange, Fingers in the noise... there's so many more.</p>
<p>As someone with an eclectic taste in music, I found myself browsing for resonator guitar songs one lazy afternoon. I discovered a loose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGyLZV_nWE">cover of "phonebooth", by a busker who plays at Park Guell in Barcelona</a>. He plays it on a well travelled resonator guitar. Two low quality videos, by passing tourists, where all I could find of his performance. Most of the youtube 'plays' on those videos are mine. The song captures something magical that I find really inspiring.</p>
<p>There's a sadness, a mourning of something passing, like the end of summer or the keening for a thing almost attained but never held. The sound of knowing enough about something to want it very badly, whilst understanding that wanting alone would never be enough to get it. A good deal of luck and chance made the possibility random to the point of almost impossible.</p>
<p>This song, in my mind, captures the sadness and frustration of not being able to do enough to get that 'something'.</p>
<p>During the song, there's a constant dance of frustration that builds to a crescendo, finally deflating to a sleepy sigh, a promise to try again next time. Never giving up. The lingering end to summer, when the air is still warm and the scent of flowers and evening cooking still strong. The loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>My hope is to translate the essence of that chewn, as I feel it, into a song that others might appreciate and something I could perform live if I had to.</p>
<p>I'll document the track creation as a learning resource to look back on and tag the series "Park Guell", to help make it easier to find.</p>
<p>I will probably make lots of mistakes; but "fail fast, fail often, fail forward" is how i roll.</p>
